          <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
          <p class="lead">I'm an aspiring developer with a lifetime background in computing. I am interested in many different areas of IT with the main ones being software and security.
            I like to keep an awareness as to what's going on in the industry of IT and making myself aware of the impact it has on the modern society. I believe the change of technology in the world thus far has been extraordinary and I look forward as to where the future is going to take us! </p>

            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p class="lead">I started out being involved with computing from a seriosuly young age back when Windows XP still had security updates. The vast majority of my knowledge has been self-taught during my own time following tutorials online or watching Youtube videos. This has allowed me to become comfortable with learning new things throughout my life and has had a huge impact on enhancing my interests in the IT industry. 
            </p>
            <h2>Where did it all start?</h2>
            <p class = "lead">I basically started out in Hardware. I have been using custom built PC's since Secondary School; I always loved placing as much over-kill into a desktop as possible back in the old days just for the simple fact that I could. From the hardware I also trained myself to a professional level with Windows Operating Systems. I would say I have lifetime experience with them along with the Microsoft Office packages. Due to my long-term experience working with computers and software I decided that it would benefit me to take up a Degree Subject doing something similar.</p>
