          <h2>BSc Hons - Computer Forensics &#38; Security </h2>
          <p class="lead">In 2014, I decided to take on a degree at Leeds Beckett University in computer forensics and security. During this degree I researched into many topics and found my most favoured interests into programming and security. Please contact me if you'd like to discuss my university experience further.</p>

          <h2>Final Year Project</h2>
          <p class="lead">For my final year project at university, I researched into the area of Android Anti-Theft and developed an application for the platform using Mobile Java in Android Studio. The aim of the application was to decrease the theft in smart phones/tablets by offering security functionality should the user misplace their device. This application also featured an external web resource in the form of a remote control in which I created using JavaScript. 
          </p>
          <p class="lead">The coding of this project involved heavy usage of API’s to allow the communication between the device and remote control. During this project I also acquired skills in project management, product design and automated testing in Android Studio.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">I was delighted to receive the offer to allow me to present my final product at the Technology Showcase at Leeds Beckett University. I also received the BCs West Yorkshire branch prize for the best individual project at my university. My project can be found on my GitHub account among other things I have worked/practiced with. https://github.com/andrewhall2469 
          </p>
          <h2> QAC - Trainee Consultant </h2>
          <p class="lead">I made the decision that I wanted to get into the devlopment sector. I recieved an offer from QAC to take on their 12 week training program to enhance my skill-set to take me a step further into the field. The following marks the courses I sat whilst here. 
          </p>
          <h2> Java SE </h2>
          <p class="lead">I started with the core syntax, researching into fundamentals needed to programme in Java. I have developed many programs using my logic and the syntax I am familiar with. I then moved on to Object Orientated programming and learnt about the usage of creating objects within classes and how the different attributes, methods and constructors work with them. 
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            I am also knowledgeable in the four core principles and have a good understanding of how they affect software development in Java. I am highly trained in Eclipse; I believe this IDE is one of my strongest due to the amount of exposure I’ve had to it. I have also had a mild introduction to Junit testing. I understand the benefits of using Junit in a TDD environment for example how actually writing the test prior to the program can quickly scope out any errors that may arise. I feel confident in my ability in Java to allow me to carry on working with it in my own time in the future.
          </p>
          <h2> Python </h2>
          <p class="lead">I started from the basics of python learning all the core fundamentals and syntax. I wrote a vast amount of different programs using the different functions learnt over the week. Created a program that stores the records depending on user input and saving them to a file.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            II am familiar with the use of functions, conditional statements, classes and objects, arrays and lists. I have created some programs which can be found on my GitHub, exampling the previously mentioned terminology. I developed my programming logic over the period of this course and I am excited to take python further in the future. It has been one of my favourite languages I have learnt about thus far in my career and I look forward to creating programs with it.
          </p>
          <h2> Agile(SCRUM), BPMN, Interview and presentation techniques </h2>
          <p class="lead">
            This course taught me the materials relevant to Agile using the scrum method of working. I learnt about material involving the usage of use-case stories from customer requirements. Also I have done research into BPMN diagrams and how they’re created depending on a current business model. I then looked into re-making them when defining a new proposed business model. During this course I also enhanced my interview and presentation techniques by researching about specific topics and presenting findings to the training group.
          </p>
          <h2> CI Foundations and Databases </h2>
          <p class="lead">
            During this course I learnt about the use of continuous integration and how it is applied in the IT sector during software development. I was introduced to the usage of the CI Pipeline and the different tools that could be applied when building testing and deploying integrations. I am experienced with GIT and using it as a version source control repository. I have also had exposure to Jenkins, Maven &#38; Vagrant and their usage in Dev-Ops. I am able to use these three tools confidently and I believe with a little more practice I can implement them professionally. I have an awareness on the need to automate tasks wherever possible during the process of CI and the need for maintaining a single source code repository during the entirety of the project.  
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            During my database training I familiarised myself with SQL commands and queries. This was a good refresher to my previous knowledge I picked up at university in which I learnt how to create databases from the ground up using Oracle’s SQL editor. I also created an interface during this time with the use of Oracle Apex. During my training I used the MySQL workbench to create a small database from an ERD that I designed within. I have a brief understanding of normalisation up to the third normalised form. 
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            I believe with the knowledge I have learnt during my training on this course I can move toward the future with a better understanding of CI and with more time researched in my own time I can develop the skills to properly implement it into my future deployments.
